# Implementation challenges

--
* The product you are buying is not the product you are getting.

--
* Highly customizable:
  * Different products.
  * Different formats (paper and virtual cards).
  * Different front covers for the same product.
  * Personal message in both card and notification.

--
* Cart & Checkout complexity: triggers.

--
* Sending mass email.

--
* Non trivial reporting.

## Campaign takeover
]

# Implementation challenges

--
* Crowdfunding itself:
  * User campaigns.
  * Offline donations.
  * Custom notification.  
  <small>Most of this became custom code.</small>

--
* Mobile version.  
  <small>Not responsive. Shame!</small>

--
* Campaign takeover.  
  <small>This was hard. Ask jotha.</small>

# Lessons learned

---

# Don't skip discovery.

--
* Keep It Simple (product and workflow).
* Define goals.
* Know your target audience.
* Make clear what is your product and what is not.
* Draw diagrams and wireframes.
* Define acceptance tests (and automate them).

--
### Descovery costs money.

--
### Not doing it costs more money.

---

# Build a good team.

--
### When outsourcing:

* Look for providers that know their technology.
* Ask for references, call them, meet them, buy them a meal.
* Require best practices to be defined and enforce them.
* When asking for quotes make sure you have a good brief.


--
### Outsource the muscle, keep the brains:

* Business-specific know-how is difficult to outsource.
* Do basic administration inhouse.
* Digital is coming! Build a digital team.
* No in-house developers? Consider third party auditing.


---
# Backend love.

Product launching is just the beginnig.

--
* A web needs maintenance:
  * Budget for it. Schedule it.
  * Make a plan. Will you update in 3 years? in 6?

--
* A web needs administration:
   * Don't forget you are also a user. Administration pages should be well thought out.
   * Think about reporting and integration with other tools you use.

--
* A web needs help:
  * Use and external email gateaway.
  * Use a monitoring service.

---
# Use the right tools

**And use the tools right**.
Using Drupal as our framework of choice, allowed us:

--
* To learn, and work with, one technology for both complex and simple projects.  
*<small>A good idea if you manage and develop serveral applications.</small>*

--
* To work with several providers and avoid lock-in.  
*<small>It's possible to change providers, but is is never easy. Foster good relationships.</small>*

--
* To write and maintain less custom code.  
*<small>Custom code has a place. Learn when to use it.</small>*

--
* To have a big knowledge base and best practices available.  
*<small>This is so useful. Invaluable.</small>*
